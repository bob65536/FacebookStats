This is a template for displaying our information about conversations analyzed. 
By uploading it (with the right files), you can make a great professional-looking 
statistics. Done on my spare time, between two refreshes of Facebook, five pages scollled on Reddit,
a few GIF on The Coding Life and two unanswered messages to friends on Messenger.-->

        <p>Who participated in this conversation? Look at this. <br />
        If you prefer a repartition depending of the number of characters, jump to <a href="#s5">section 5</a>.

      <h4>Section 3: Daily & Monthly repartitions</h4>
      <div id="s3"></div>
        <p>This section allows you to see your activity with a longer term. <br />
        <figure>
          <a href="./05a-dateMsgPerDay.png"><img src="./05a-dateMsgPerDay{{sizeImg}}.png" alt="Daily repartition of the messages" width={{widthImg}}></a>
          <figcaption>Fig. 3a: Daily repartition of the messages</figcaption>
        </figure> </p>
        <p>You can see three diamonds on the bottom of these graphes. Each diamond represents a quarter. Between each diamond, a quarter of messages have been written. <br />
        Interpretation: 
        <ul>
          <li>Half of all messages have been written before/after <b>{{Q2}}</b>. </li>
          <li>Also, you wrote one quarter of all messages between the <abbr title={{firstMsgShort}}>beginning of the conversation</abbr> and <b>{{Q1}}</b></li>
          <li>The last quarter spans between <b>{{Q3}}</b> and <abbr title={{lastMsgShort}}>now</abbr>.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><i>If lines are too thin, let's take a step backwards and check the monthly repartition.</i>

      <h4>Section 4: Reactions</h4>
      <div id="s4"></div>
        <p>On almost all conversations, the receiver(s) may react to messages, in different ways. The next graphes will show you how!<br />
        <b>Fun fact: {{nbMsgReac}} messages ({{percentMsgReac}}%) led to a reaction. <br /></b>
        <figure>
          <a href="./06a-reacSent.png"><img src="./06a-reacSent{{sizeImg}}.png" alt="Reactions sent (if empty: no one reacted)" width={{widthImg}}> </a>
          <figcaption>Fig. 4: Reactions sent</figcaption>
        </figure> </p>

      <hr />
      <h4>Section 5: Length of messages</h4>
      <div id="s5"></div>
        <p>Size matters. <del>Your wife told you so.</del> In this section, we will see how many times you hit your poor keyboard for discussing with your friend <i>{{name}}</i>.
        <br />
        <figure>
          <a href="./07-lenMsg.png"><img src="./07-lenMsg{{sizeImg}}.png" alt="Participation by characters written" width={{widthImg}}> </a>
          <figcaption>Fig. 5a: Participation <i>by characters written</i></figcaption>
        </figure> </p>
        <p>Why such a big difference with <a href="#s1">the first figure</a>? Because each participant sends shorter or longer messages. <br />
        Here is a proof.
        <figure>
          <a href="./09-lengthOfMsg.png"><img src="./09-lengthOfMsg{{sizeImg}}.png" alt="Average length of messages" width={{widthImg}}> </a>

      <h4>Section 6: Starters and Lovers</h4>
      <div id="s6"></div>
        <p>If you are with someone (wowowo, relax! It is just an example!) and you start questioning the reciprocity of your relationship, this section <strong>might</strong> help you (but keep a critical point of view, please) -- see end note. 
        <br />
        <figure>
          <a href="./08-behaviorStats.png"><img src="./08-behaviorStats{{sizeImg}}.png" alt="Starters and nuber of hearts" width={{widthImg}}> </a>
          <figcaption>Fig. 6: How often do you start conversations and who sends hearts?</figcaption>
        </figure> </p>
        <p><i>How long are your messages on average before ending? A big figure may underline a long and interesting conversation.</i><br />
        In this case, each one of the {{nbConv}} coversations lasted <b>{{lenMsgConv}}</b> messages (on average) before dying.</p>

      <hr />
      <h4>Section 7: Misc</h4>
      <div id="s7"></div>
        <p>Here, I listed some interesting graphes which do not fit in any section. <br />
        In there, you will find info about:
        <ul>
          <li>Length of silences (>1 day)</li>
          <li>How many 'Du coup' are said</li>
          <li>And other figures... one day.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><i>This graph shows the evolution of silence periods between conversations (above 1 day). If the line is rising, this might show a loss of interest over time...<br />
        On the other hand, if dates are outdated, either no messages are sent since a long time or conversation never stops running.</i>
        <figure>
          <a href="./10-lengthOfSilences.png"><img src="./10-lengthOfSilences{{sizeImg}}.png" alt="Length of silences" width={{widthImg}}> </a>
          <figcaption>Fig. 7a: Length of silences?</figcaption>
        </figure> </p>

        <p>Du coup<i> (or 'so...') is a French expression said too much times. So much that some might be bothered by this expression. </i>Du coup, <i>how often do participants said that?</i>
        <figure>
          <a href="./11-duCoup.png"><img src="./11-duCoup{{sizeImg}}.png" alt="[[If you read this, no one said 'Du coup' in this conversation.]]" width={{widthImg}}> </a>
          <figcaption>Fig. 7b: Du coup, how often do participants said 'Du coup'?</figcaption>
        </figure> </p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>If you read this, it means this report have been interesting. Thank you for having read everything :) <br />
    Even if the data are a direct interpretation of your logs, do not take that for an absolute truth. <br />
    Here are points that might alter these information (and notes):
    <ul>
      <li>Only data from Messenger are processed. So, other interaction (SMS, phone calls, meetings, etc) are not included here.</li>
      <li>You can merge data from other backups. But if the name of the conversation changed, you may have moments without data.</li>
      <li>One data can have different meanings. Keep a critical point of view on the results.</li>
      <li>If you do something bad with these results, I won't be held responsible. </li>
      <li>Other functionalities will be added. Don't forget to check regularly my <a href="https://github.com/bob65536">GitHub</a> for bugfixes.</li>
