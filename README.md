# Facebook_Stats
Do you want to make stats about your conversations with your friends on Messenger? I have what you need!

Step 1: Request a copy of your data (https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=your_facebook_information).  
Step 2: Select the date range you wish (All of my data is great but can take more time).  
Step 3: Important: Use JSON as the format of your data. Otherwise, the program would be useless. The quality of the media does not matter here (high would take more time).   
Step 4: Wait until the archive is available (this can take between one and fifteen days).  

After that, for this version, you need to put the Python program and the message log (file called "message.json") on the same directory.   
This program is both compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 (normally - not tested).   
To run the program: launch in a console python ./messagesStats.py and wait for a while (the graphs are generated in less than one minute).  

More information will be provided later.
